This repository is both a product and reproducibility asset from the MSc research developed by Lorraine Trento Oliveira.
Entitled 'EXPLORING THE DIVERSITY OF DEPRIVED AREAS: THE APPLICATIONS OF UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING AND OPEN GEODATA', the thesis proposed to explore the potential of unsupervised machine learning models for characterizing deprived areas based on morphological and environmental features using solely open geodata and presenting diaggregated outputs. The results show the capability of the pilot state-of-art model with high transferability and scalability potential and proved the relevance of open data framework and
data mining techniques, particularly to Low- to Middle Income Countries (LMICs).

The scripts provided in this folder contain data processing and machine learning modelling steps.
